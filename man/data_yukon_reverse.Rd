Data from
Hamazaki, T. and DeCovich, N. (2014).
Application of the Genetic Markâ€“Recapture Technique for Run Size Estimation of Yukon River Chinook Salmon.
North American Journal of Fisheries Management, 34, 276-286.
DOI: 10.1080/02755947.2013.869283
This is the data from the 2011 data in Table 2 of the above paper.
Estimated that total escapement to Canada (plus  harvest)
was 66,225 (SE 1574)
Estimated that proportion of stock that was Canadian was .34644 (SE .030)
We converted this into a "sample size" and number of fish with Cdn genetics
that gave the same SE.
