## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.4.2
* devtools::check_win_release()
* devtools::check_win_devel()
* rhub::rhub_check()

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs in local OS X install, win_release(), win_devel().
Rhub_check() often fails when trying to install rjags and jags. I don't think I can "fix" those issues.

## Reverse dependencies

None.
