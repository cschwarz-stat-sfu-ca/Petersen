\details{
Data is slightly different from that in paper above because some fish did not
have length measured and so were drop from data_wae_is_long and this is the
condensed version of data_wae_is_long.

Fish were tagged on the spawning grounds and
recovered in the summer gillnet assessment.

Rather than sexing all of the fish, only a sub-sample of unmarked fish
is sexed at each sampling occasion. Possible capture histories are then
M0, F0, MM, FF, U0, UU, 0M, 0F
