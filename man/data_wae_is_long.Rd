\details{
Fish were tagged on the spawning grounds and
recovered in the summer gillnet assessment.

Length was measured a both times and didn't not change
very much between the two sampling occasions. The value
recorded below is the average of the two lengths if both
lengths were present.

Rather than sexing all of the fish, only a sub-sample of unmarked fish
is sexed at each sampling occasion. Possible capture histories are then
M0, F0, MM, FF, U0, UU, 0M, 0F
