The Siren Call of the Schaefer Estimator.
Schwarz, C.J. and Arnason, A.N.


At the moment, this directory only contains a copy of the poster presented
at the 2000 Statistical Society of Canada Annual Meeting held in Ottawa
in June 2000.

Files:
   schaefer.pdf - A pdf document containing the poster.
                  This is 36 x 36 inches (1m x 1m).
                  If you print on a 600 dpi+ printer and force it to
                  print on a single page, it is still quite readable.
