The files in this directory are:
    paper.tex     - a tex file containing the paper
    template.tex  - a template used to format the paper according to Biometrics standards
    rotate.tex    - a template used to rotate the large tables at the end of the paper

    paper.ps      - a postscript version of the paper
    paper.pdf     - a PDF version of the paper
                    NOTE: because of font substitution problems, the *.ps and *.pdf files
                    don't look very clean when printed.
 
    Figure1.ps    - a plot of simulation results. This appeared in the reviewer copies of 
                    the paper, but was cut during the final editorial process. If you wish
                    more details on this Figure, please contact me.

You will need to download all the *.tex files and place them in the same directory.
Then use the command:
    tex paper.tex
to generate the paper.dvi file and
    dvips paper.dvi
to generate the postscript file which can be sent to the printer.

When running the tex program, there is an apparent error in one of the equations. Just ignore 
it, the output seems just fine. Darn if I can find the source of the problem - any help would be
appreciated!
