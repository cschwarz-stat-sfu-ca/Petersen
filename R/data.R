#' Estimating abundance of outgoing smolt - BTSPAS - diagonal case
#'
#' This is the first diagonal case dataset from BTSPAS.
#'
#' Consider an experiment to estimate the number of outgoing smolts on a small river. The
#' run of smolts extends over several weeks. As smolts migrate, they are captured and marked
#' with individually numbered tags and released at the first capture location using, for example, a
#' fishwheel. The migration continues, and a second fishwheel takes a second sample several
#' kilometers down stream. At the second fishwheel, the captures consist of a mixture of marked
#' (from the first fishwheel) and unmarked fish.
#'
#' The efficiency of the fishwheels varies over time in response to stream flow, run size passing
#' the wheel and other uncontrollable events. So it is unlikely that the capture probabilities are
#' equal over time at either location, i.e. are heterogeneous over time.
#'
#' We suppose that we can temporally stratify the data into, for example, weeks, where the
#' capture-probabilities are (mostly) homogeneous at each wheel in each week. Furthermore, suppose that
#' fish captured and marked in each week tend to migrate together so that they are
#' captured in a single subsequent stratum. For example,
#' suppose that in each julian week \eqn{j}{j}, \eqn{n1_j}{n1_j} fish are marked and released above the rotary screw trap.
#' Of these, \eqn{m2_j}{m2_j} are recaptured. All recaptures take place in the week of release,
#' i.e. the matrix of releases and recoveries is diagonal.
#' The \eqn{n1_j}{n1_j} and \eqn{m2_j}{m2_j} establish the capture efficiency of the second trap in julian week \eqn{j}{j}.
#'
#' At the same time, \eqn{u2_j}{u2_j} unmarked fish are captured at the screw trap.
#'
#' Capture-efficiency may be related to flow, so the log(flow) is also recorded.

#' Capture-recapture on Kokanee in Metolius River with tag loss
#'
#'  This is the data from  Hyun et al (2012).
#'  In August and September 2007, the period just before the spawning run,
#'  adult kokanee were collected by beach seining in the upper arm of the
#'  lake near the confluence with the Metolius River.
#'  Fish were tagged with nonpermanent, plastic T-bar anchor tags
#'   and then were released back into the lake.
#'    Randomly selected fish received single tags of one color,
#'    while the other fish received two tags of a second color (i.e., the double tags were identical in color).
#'  In late September through October, spawning ground surveys were conducted by 2â€“3 people walking
#'  abreast in a downstream direction (or floating, in sections where the water depth and flow were too great to allow walking).
#'  Instead of being physically recaptured, the fish were resighted as they swam freely in the clear,
#'  relatively shallow water within the spawning areas of the river.
#'  The total number of fish observed with or without a tag (or tags) was recorded for each section,
#'  and information on the number and color of tags for each marked fish was also noted.
#'
#'  Because fish were not handled, it is not possible to know which of the double tags were lost, and so only
#'  models with equal retention probabilities and non-distinguishable double tags should be fit. Note
#'  that the capture history for a lost of 1 indistinguishable tag is 111X rather than 1110 or 1101 (both of
#'  which are not allowed in the model with indistinguishable double tags)
